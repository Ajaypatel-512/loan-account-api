# Loan Account API

This project is a Spring Boot-based application that handles loan account details, specifically related to Equated Monthly Installments (EMI). It connects to an external service to fetch loan account information, stores this data in a database, and provides the details as a JSON response.

# Technologies Used
Spring Boot: The main framework for building the application.

JPA/Hibernate: For working with the database and mapping Java objects to database tables.

H2 Database: An in-memory database used for testing (no need to set up a separate database).

Jackson: Used to convert Java objects to JSON and vice versa.
